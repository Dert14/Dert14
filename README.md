ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Marcin, currently in my second stage of polytechnic, where my first stage was focused on Automatics and Robotics. Now, I'm a passionate first-year student diving into the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Armed with Python as my primary tool, I'm on a journey to explore the depths of AI algorithms and their applications in solving real-world problems.

ðŸ§  My current focus lies in understanding the intricacies of machine learning models, from classic algorithms to cutting-edge deep learning architectures. I'm always eager to learn and contribute to projects that push the boundaries of what AI can achieve.

ðŸ’» While Python is my go-to language, you'll also find me tinkering with C/C++ in my IoT projects. Leveraging the power of AWS, I've embarked on creating innovative solutions that bridge the physical and digital worlds, exploring the potential of connected devices to revolutionize industries.

ðŸŒŸ Looking to connect with like-minded individuals, collaborate on exciting projects, and contribute to open-source initiatives that drive technological progress. Let's build the future together, one line of code at a time!
